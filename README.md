# Blackmagic HyperDeck Remote Transport

A simple Python/Tkinter app for controlling Blackmagic HyperDeck 4K devices over the network.  
This tool provides a GUI with familiar transport controls (play, stop, record, etc.) and polls the HyperDeck API to display current status in real time.

## Features
- Connect to HyperDeck units via IP over your local network  
- Remote control playback, stop, record, and other transport functions  
- Live status updates pulled from the HyperDeck REST API  
- Lightweight GUI built with Tkinter, no special hardware required  

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 (or newer)  
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (fast Python package/dependency manager)  

Install **uv** using pip:
```bash
pip install uv
```

Verify installation:
```bash
uv --version
```

## Setup
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/blackmagic-transport.git
cd blackmagic-transport
```

Create a virtual environment with uv:
```bash
uv venv
```

Activate the environment:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install requests certifi
```

## Usage
Run the app:
```bash
uv run blackmagic-transport.py
```

## Notes
- HyperDeck devices must have their API enabled and be reachable on your network.  
- Designed for HyperDeck Studio 4K models, but may work with other recent HyperDeck units that expose the REST API.
